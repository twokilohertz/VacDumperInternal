# To-do list

* Work around having to use a while loop with a sleep statement
* Use a different (undetected?) hooking mechanism: detour, trampoline, midfunction, etc.
* Add (more) error checking to Windows API calls which can fail for whatever reason
* Implement passing a string (std::string, wchar_t/char array) as a search pattern
* Don't hardcode the dumped modules path (C:\DumpoMode at the moment lmao)
